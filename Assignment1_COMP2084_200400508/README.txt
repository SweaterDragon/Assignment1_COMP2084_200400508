This is a basic MVC web application, made as an assignment for a college course. The application functions
as a wizard library, using a database to hold information about tomes and spells.

This is Assignment 2, but since it was built off of "Assignment1_COMP2084_200400508", the name remains

The "master" branch contains an error, and upon reverting to a previous commit github would no longer
allow me to make commits. Thus, the current branch "newmaster" was created.

Several parts of this application are unfinished

The free trial on azure has expired since part 1 of the assignment. The database is temporarily being paid for.
