This is a basic MVC web application, made as an assignment for a college course. The application functions
as a wizard library, using a database to hold information about tomes and spells.

NOTE: The "master" branch contains an error, and upon reverting to a previous commit github would no longer
allow me to make commits. Thus, the current branch "newmaster" was created.
